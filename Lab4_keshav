Lab 4 - Functions and Lists 
(100 marks in total, including 7 exercises)

Author:  Keshav Makker
Due Date: This Friday (Feb. 2) 11am.

Objective:
1. Practice coding simple Python functions and writing unit tests testing functions by assert
2. Practice how to operate on lists
3. Practice with iterations using loop
4. Practice with the boolean expression and conditionals
5. Practice using the accumulator algorithm pattern (Initialize-Loop-Return):
   Initialize a variable that is assigned to an integer, a list, etc. 
   Loop (for or while) to update the variable based on requirements; 
   Return the variable or a value related to this variable.

Example 1: 

To implement a function for calculating the perimeter of a rectangle,
we know this function should have two parameters as inputs: length and width
of a rectangle.
We should also know this function should return a value of the perimeter.
Before or after our function implementation, we know that our function, let's say,
function's name is rectangle_perimeter, shoud pass the unit tests such as:
assert rectangle_perimeter(5, 6) == 22
assert rectangle_perimeter(1.25, 2.43) == 7.36
assert rectangle_perimeter(1.001, 2.005) == 6.01
"""

def rectangle_perimeter(length, width):
    perimeter = (length + width) * 2
    return round(perimeter, 2) # Round to the result to two decimal places

assert rectangle_perimeter(1.25, 2.43) == 7.36
assert rectangle_perimeter(1.001, 2.005) == 6.01

"""
Exercise 1 (10 marks)

1 US dollar is around 1.34 Canadian dollars.
Write a function that takes American dollars as input 
and return the Canadian dollars equivalent. 

Requirement: Use round() to round the result to two decimal places.
For example, convert_american_dollars(100.05) should return 134.07

assert (convert_american_dollars(100) == 134)

Exercise 3 (15 marks) - From interactive textbook 10.31.4

Exercise 5 (15 marks) 

Write a function called evens() that takes a list of numbers nums as its parameter

1. Use a moduler operator % to check if a num is even. 
2. Create a variable assigned to an empty list [], 
and use the append() to add the required elements to the list.
